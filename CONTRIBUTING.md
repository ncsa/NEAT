Contributing
------------

Currently, the major effort NEAT is focused on bringing the code up to [PEP 8 standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), as well as leveraging Biopython and Pandas to speed up analysis. We have plans to increase NEAT's utility for a wider range of genomic situations, such as plants, bacteria, and complex features like cancer.

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes
 
Note: Be sure to merge the latest changes before making the pull request. You can increase your chances of a successfull pull request by indicating clearly what branch you are contributing to and making a detailed commit message. It also helps if you open an issue first to let us know you are working on this project.
