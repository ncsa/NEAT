## Template for gen_reads parallel
## Any parameter that is not required but has a default value will use the
## default value even if the variable is not included in the config. For
## required items, they must be included in the config and the must be given a value.
## All other items can be present or not. If present and the value is set to a single
## period, the variable will be treated as though it had been omitted. Please do
## not modify this template, but instead make a copy in your working directory. Done this
## way, you can run without even needing to declare -c.

# attempt to process one contig per thread. However, if you have very
# large fasta files, you will see additional runtime benefit from choosing
# the subdivision method, which will split the contigs up into equal sizes
# for processing. If you need further speedups and have access to a distributed system
# you can use a shell script wrapper around NEAT to split the fasta into
# contigs, then join the results later. NEAT does not feature translocations, so
# this will not affect NEAT's output. Note that subdivision will only activate for
